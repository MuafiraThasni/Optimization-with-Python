# Optimization-with-Python
This Repository contains my learning activities for the Udemy course " Optimization with Python, Solving Operations Research Problems"

Operational planning and long term planning for companies are more complex in recent years. Information changes fast, and the decision making is a hard task. Therefore, optimization algorithms (operations research) are used to find optimal solutions for these problems. Professionals in this field are one of the most valued in the market.

 =============================================

Linear Programming (LP)

Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)

NonLinear Programming (NLP)

Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MINLP)

Genetic Algorithm (GA)

Particle Swarm (PSO)

Constraint Programming (CP)

Second-Order Cone Programming (SCOP)

NonConvex Quadratic Programmin (QP)



solvers and frameworks explored:
