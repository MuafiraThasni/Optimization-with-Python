# Optimization-with-Python
This Repository contains my learning activities for the Udemy course " Optimization with Python, Solving Operations Research Problems"

Operational planning and long term planning for companies are more complex in recent years. Information changes fast, and the decision making is a hard task. Therefore, optimization algorithms (operations research) are used to find optimal solutions for these problems. Professionals in this field are one of the most valued in the market.

 Mathematical Optimization and Metaheuristics:
 =============================================

Linear Programming (LP)

Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)

NonLinear Programming (NLP)

Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MINLP)

Genetic Algorithm (GA)

Particle Swarm (PSO)

Constraint Programming (CP)

Second-Order Cone Programming (SCOP)

NonConvex Quadratic Programmin (QP)



Solvers and frameworks explored:
================================

Solvers: CPLEX – Gurobi – GLPK – CBC – IPOPT – Couenne – SCIP

Frameworks: Pyomo – Or-Tools – PuLP

Same Packages and tools: Geneticalgorithm – Pyswarm – Numpy – Pandas – MatplotLib – Spyder – Jupyter Notebook




Problems  solved :
==================
( I have changed the problems from the course a little bit, inorder to improve my learning skills and also to avoid the copyright issues )

1. Optimization on how to install a fence in a garden: A rectangular shaped garden has to be fenced. Find the maximum area that can be fenced by using a 150 m fence. The garden is already fenced at one side by using a rock wall.

2. Maximize the revenue in a rental car store: Number of cars : 55<= N <= 250, price = 1000-5*(number of cars rented), maximize the reveneu

3. Optimal Power Flow: Electrical Systems: Power flow optimization problem. 
    Solving Process: First convert the given one line diagram in to mathematical model. Then reqired data are stored using Excel sheets. Pandas can be used to fetch data from    these sheets. 
    i) Read data from Excel sheets
    ii) Define Variables
    iii) Defeine Objective function
    iv) Solve problem using Gurobi
